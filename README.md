## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

If you use VS Code this it how it works:

- Install the Garmin Connect IQ SDK
- Install the "Monkey C" extension for VS Code
- Configure your VS Code settings.json to include the SDK path:

json:
Copy
{
    "connectiq.sdkPath": "path/to/your/connectiq-sdk"
}

- Create a new Connect IQ project using the folder structure above
- Build the project using the Connect IQ: Build command in VS Code
- Test in the simulator using Connect IQ: Run in Simulator

I did not get the IQ Store compatible .iq file with VS Code compiler. It only worked from the terminal.
Also, make sure you donÂ´t get any warnings, the Store validator is very picky.

### Installation

Clone the repository and you should be ok!
